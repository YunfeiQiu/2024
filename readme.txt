In the watermark embedding and extraction process, the quaternions are first used to correlate the color channels, effectively solving the problem of traditional watermarking schemes neglecting the correlations of color channels and the difficulties of watermark synchronous embedding. Then, an approximate Schur decomposition is performed on the embedding block, and the maximum energy coefficients generated after matrix decomposition are used to achieve watermark embedding and blind extraction through quaternion quantization index modulation (QQIM), in which the image correction is considered after geometric attacks. Owing to the intricate calculations required for quaternions, this paper uses an algebraic structure-preserving algorithm to transform quaternion calculations into real and complex number calculations, improving algorithm efficiency.
